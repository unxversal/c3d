# C3D Examples

This folder contains example STL files that you can use to test the C3D viewer and familiarize yourself with the CLI.

## Files

- **PlanetGear.stl** - A complex planetary gear assembly that demonstrates advanced 3D geometry

## Usage

You can access these example files using the C3D interactive library browser:

```bash
c3d list
```

This launches an interactive screen where you can:
- Use arrow keys to navigate through files
- Filter files by typing to search
- Press Enter to open any file in the 3D viewer
- Browse files from common directories (Downloads, Documents, Desktop, etc.)

## Adding Your Own Examples

Feel free to add your own STL files to this directory. The `c3d list` command will automatically discover them and make them available in the library browser.

## File Requirements

- Files must have the `.stl` extension
- Both ASCII and binary STL formats are supported
- Files should be reasonably sized for good performance in the web viewer
